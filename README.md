# LBI.MM <br> (Long Beach Island Mental Model)

This repository is an experiment in version control for a figure that will go through many iterations over the course of months, maybe years. The figure is a *conceptual model* visualized using nodes and arrows. It's is a *living document* and a *boundary object* supporting integration and understanding across participants in a research collaboration. 

The figure versions are generated on the Kumu platform: https://kumu.io/. The platform uses a point-and-click interface, but underlying code can be downloaded as a json file. These files can be uploaded to Kumu to recreate the editable visualization. 

We want to keep track of figure versions and create a record of the figure's evolution. The record-keeping part may support problem-framing narratives as well as research about the conceptual modeling practice. Github-ing downloaded json files, together with commit notes, seems like it could be a helpful part of record keeping. We'll see how it goes.

I'm also downloading and archiving svg files, in part so that the most recently logged figure version (Forsythe.svg) can be viewed here on the repository. The up-to-the-minute current figure will always be publicly available on Kumu: https://kumu.io/cmh455/forsythe â€“ though it may sometimes be under construction between archived versions.
