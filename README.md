# LBI.MM <br> (Long Beach Island Mental Model)

This repository is an experiment in version control for a figure that will go through many iterations over the course of months, maybe years. The figure is a *conceptual model* visualized using nodes and arrows. It's is a *living document* and a *boundary object* supporting integration and understanding across participants in a research collaboration. 

The figure versions are generated on the Kumu platform: https://kumu.io/. The platform uses a point-and-click interface, but underlying code can be downloaded as a json file. These files can be uploaded to Kumu to recreate the editable visualization. 

We want to keep track of figure versions and create a record of the figure's evolution. The record-keeping part may support research about the conceptual modeling practice. Github-ing downloaded json files, together with commit notes, seems like it could be a helpful part of record keeping. We'll see how it goes.

The current figure will always be here (and publicly visible) on Kumu: https://kumu.io/cmh455/forsythe
